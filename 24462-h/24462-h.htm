<h1>O DESASTRE DE LISBOA</h1>


<h2>I</h2>

<div class="poesia">
Tornou-se escuro o céu, sol não se via;<br>
Medonha tempestade se formava;<br>
O solo, se gretando, estremecia<br>
E n'um abysmo grande se tornava!<br>
Lisboa nunca viu tão triste dia;<br>
Perdida toda a gente se julgava;<br>
As casas, sacudidas, oscilavam<br>
E pelo gran' tremor se esmoronavam!<br>
</div>


<h2>II</h2>

<div class="poesia">
O cataclismo nada respeitava;<br>
Palacios, templos, casas destruia,<br>
E nos tristes destroços abysmava<br>
Os miseros que n'elles envolvia.<br>
Uma desgraça tal ninguem poupava<br>
Á grande mortandade, que fazia:<br>
E sob as cantarias deslocadas<br>
As gentes expiravam sepultadas.<br>
</div>


<h2>III</h2>

<div class="poesia">
Em mui breves momentos... a cidade<br>
O mais lugubre quadro apresentava.<br>
Os habitantes, cheios d'anciedade<br>
Que tamanho terror lhes inspirava<br>
E de Deus supplicando, em vão, piedade,<br>
Fugiam para a rua, onde reinava<br>
Na triste, apavorada multidão<br>
A mais indiscriptivel confusão.<br>
</div>


<h2>IV</h2>

<div class="poesia">
Abandonando as casas procuravam<br>
Immersos não ficarem nas ruinas:<br>
Mas, aquelles que d'ellas escapavam,<br>
Sob o ferro das gentes assassinas,<br>
Que d'essa confusão se aproveitavam,<br>
Nas ruas saqueando--almas ferinas!--,<br>
Succumbiram;--que o ferro lhes tirava<br>
Vida, que o terremoto respeitava.<br>
</div>


<h2>V</h2>

<div class="poesia">
E, qual mimosa flor desabrochada<br>
Que cuidadoso trata o jardineiro<br>
Por aspero tufão sendo açoutada<br>
Barbaramente, perde a côr e o cheiro,<br>
E sobre a tenra haste já quebrada<br>
Vai definhando, e morre no canteiro;<br>
Assim as creancinhas, que perdidas<br>
Das mães estavam, eram consumidas.<br>
</div>


<h2>VI</h2>

<div class="poesia">
E, como se uma tal desolação<br>
A flagello das gentes não bastasse,<br>
Bandidos houve que com impia mão<br>
E para que o terror se accrescentasse<br>
N'esta já desditosa occasião,<br>
Um incendio atearam que queimasse,<br>
Nas devorantes chammas que nutriam,<br>
As casas que aos abalos resistiam.<br>
</div>


<h2>VII</h2>

<div class="poesia">
Que perversos instinctos, vis, horriveis<br>
Alimentavam peitos tão malvados!...<br>
Esses torpes facinoras, temiveis,<br>
Dos negros calabouços escapados;<br>
Do infortunio ás vozes insensiveis,<br>
Sem dó nem compaixão dos desgraçados,<br>
Que attonitos nas ruas encontravam,<br>
Os mais horrendos crimes practicavam.<br>
</div>


<h2>VIII</h2>

<div class="poesia">
Esses profugos, todos criminosos<br>
E talvez nas masmorras pervertidos;<br>
Homicidas, ladrões industriosos<br>
Que não estão do vicio inda esquecidos;<br>
D'entre ferros sahindo furiosos,<br>
Por toda a parte correm atrevidos,<br>
O terror augmentando na cidade<br>
Que entregue fica á sua impiedade.<br>
</div>


<h2>IX</h2>

<div class="poesia">
Dos destroços que as ruas impediam,<br>
E centos de cadaveres juncavam,<br>
Dilacerantes gritos se partiam<br>
Dos feridos que n'elles se encontravam,<br>
E lugubres gemidos se sentiam<br>
Dos que em terriveis ancias expiravam!<br>
Outros emfim, correndo desesp'rados,<br>
Ao Tejo se lançavam. Malfadados!...<br>
</div>


<h2>X</h2>

<div class="poesia">
Mas de repente um vulto grandioso,<br>
De excessivo talento e arrojado,<br>
Da patria pelo amor tão orgulhoso,<br>
Por tantas vezes já por si mostrado;<br>
Tantas victimas vendo, pressuroso<br>
Tratou de castigar tanto malvado,<br>
E com duras medidas que adoptou<br>
O negro vandalismo terminou;<br>
</div>


<h2>XI</h2>

<div class="poesia">
E, com essa energia portentosa<br>
De que dotado foi tão largamente,<br>
O estadista de fama gloriosa<br>
Que á patria lembrará eternamente,<br>
A do Tejo rainha tão formosa<br>
Reedificar consegue brevemente.<br>
--E qual flor escapada ao vendaval<br>
Altiva se ergue a linda capital!<br>
</div>


<h2>XII</h2>

<div class="poesia">
Salve, <span class="small-caps">Marquez</span>, a quem Pombal foi berço,<br>
Mais tarde exilio, tumulo na morte!<br>
Do sepulchro em que ha tanto estás immerso<br>
Julgo ver-te surgir altivo e forte:<br>
E, Portugal mostrando ao universo,<br>
Dizeres:--«Eil-a! A patria... foi meu norte;<br>
Hoje, reliquia de passadas glorias,<br>
Como outr'ora não conta já victorias!»<br>
</div>


<h2>XIII</h2>

<div class="poesia">
Após cem annos de teu somno infindo<br>
Esquecido não é teu genio ingente.<br>
Da historia nossa as paginas abrindo,<br>
Aonde a gloria tua é tão patente,<br>
Haverá portuguez que, amor sentindo<br>
P'la patria cara, outr'ora tão fulgente,<br>
Penhorado não lembre o que fizeste<br>
A Portugal que tanto enobreceste?!<br>
</div>


<h2>XIV</h2>

<div class="poesia">
O que importa o dormir da sepultura<br>
Após a vida á patria dedicada,<br>
Se do tempo ou da morte a lima dura<br>
Gastar não póde a gloria conquistada,<br>
Que pela mesma morte já está pura<br>
Se no exilio não foi purificada?!<br>
Festejai portuguezes esse vulto<br>
A quem devemos todos prestar culto!<br>

Eis que chega o momento em que a nação<br>

De nobres sentimentos animada,<br>

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
